# Ignite_fooddelivery-project
During my internship at Ignite, I developed a  food delivery website . The frontend is built with React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,. XML was used for data structuring. On the backend, I employed Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side operations and API creation, with MongoDB as the database for storing user, menu, and order information.
